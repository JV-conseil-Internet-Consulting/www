      "content": "This chapter covers advanced topics, such as offline support and custom JS builds. Codings skills are recommended.\n\n\n  Enabling offline support    \n      How offline storage works\n    \n  \n  Adding a custom social media icon    \n      Creating the icon font\n      Adding the platform’s metadata\n    \n  \n  How CSS is organized in DeepDive\n\n\nEnabling offline support\n\nDeepDive v8 introduces experimental “cache as you go” offline support. This is implemented via the Service Worker API, a new browser standard that is now supported in the latest versions of all major browsers. However, it is a very powerful feature and should be used with a lot of care.\n\nEnabling this feature requires that your content meets the following criteria:\n\n\n  Content doesn’t change between deploys (e.g. manually adding things to _site etc.)\n  All assets in assets are immutable, i.e. they never change (when changing a file in assets, it needs to have a new name and links need to point to the new file).\n  The site is mostly self-contained, i.e. assets are served from the same domain (offline support will not download assets form external sites by default)\n  The site is served via HTTPS (this is a Service Worker requirement)\n\n\nTo enable this feature, create a sw.js file in the root of your project and add the following content:\n\n---\n---\nimportScripts(\"{{ '/assets/js/sw.js' | relative_url }}?t={{ site.time | date_to_xmlschema }}\");\n\n\nThis will load the main service worker script from DeepDive’s assets. The site.time part is necessary to make the service worker “byte different” every time you create a new build of your site, which triggers an update.\n\nIn your config.yml under the deepdive key, add the following:\n\noffline:\n  enabled: true\n  cache_version: 1\n\n\nThe current implementation does not cache resources from external domains. There is now way of knowing if external sites conform to the conditions mentioned above, hence caching can be problematic and result in unexpected behavior.\n\nFor example, Google Analytics uses GET requests to send page views, each of which would be cached by the service worker without this policy. Frequently updating images, such as badges would never change.\n\n\n\nHowever, if you include resources that are hosted on another domain and don’t change, you can add the sw-cache query parameter to the URL, e.g.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/57_Chevy_210.jpg?sw-cache\n\n\nThis will cause them to be cached like resources from the assets folder.\n\nIf you want to serve a file from the assets folder but NOT cache it for offline use, add the no-cache query parameter instead:\n\n/assets/lfs/download.bin?no-cache\n\n\n\n\nHow offline storage works\n\nDeepDive’s custom service worker implementation stores files for offline use on three different levels:\n\n\n  Shell\n  The shell files are the core DeepDive files (CSS, JS) that only change between version updates.\nIf you made changes to any of these after enabling offline support, you must force an update by bumping the cache_version number in the config file.\n  Assets\n  These are presumed to be immutable. In other words, every file is cached indefinitely. E.g.: If you want to update an image after enabling offline support, add the image under a different name and change the link in the content. Alternatively, you can bump the cache_version, but this will remove all other cached files from the asset cache.\n  Content\n  The content cache exploits the fact that your content can’t change between builds, so that it can be stored for offline use until you upload a new build. For now, the entire content cache is discarded every time you publish new content (future versions could cache them based on last modified dates).\n\n\nOther things to note are that the implementation will always cache the pages listed under legal, as well as the 404.html page, which will be shown when the user is offline.\n\nAdding a custom social media icon\n\nDeepDive includes a number of social media icons by default (in fact, everything that is provided by IcoMoon), but since the landscape is always changing, it is likely that a platform that is important to you will be missing at some point.\n\nYou can add any platform by simply providing a complete URL. However, a fallback icon  will be used.\n\nCreating the icon font\n\nIn order to add a custom social media icon you have to use the IcoMoon App (free) to create a custom icon webfont. However, it is important that the generated font include all icons already in use by DeepDive. For this purpose, find the selection.json in assets/icomoon/selection.json and upload it to the app via “Import Icons”.\nThen, use the app to add your icon(s).\nConsult the IcoMoon docs for additional help.\n\nOnce you’ve created and downloaded the icon font form IconMoon, replace the icomoon folder in assets in its entirety. Keep in mind that future updates of DeepDive will override this folder.\n\nAdding the platform’s metadata\n\nFor the second step it is necessary to add the network’s metadata to _data/social.yml.\nAn entry looks like:\n\ndeviantart:\n  name: DeviantArt\n  icon: icon-deviantart\n  prepend: \"https://\"\n  append: \".deviantart.com\"\n\n\n\n  name\n  The name of the network. Used for the title attribute and screen readers.\n  icon\n  The icon CSS class. Can be chosen during the IcoMoon creation process.\n  prepend\n  Optional. A string that is prepended to the username to form the link to the profile. If the final URL should be https://&lt;username&gt;.deviantart.com, this would be https://\n  append\n  Optional. A string that is appended to the username to form the link to the profile. If the final URL should be https://&lt;username&gt;.deviantart.com, this would be .deviantart.com.\n\n\nHow CSS is organized in DeepDive\n\nDeepDive takes a quite unique approach to CSS, which is motivated by the ability to\ninline essential CSS rules in a style tag in the &lt;head/&gt; of a page (to increase the loading speed),\nwhile serving the rest in a separate file.\n\nThe styles are written in SCSS and are located in the _sass folder, which looks like\n\n├── deepdive\n│   ├── __inline__\n│   ├── __link__\n│   ├── _base.pre.scss\n│   ├── ...\n│   └── _social.pre.scss\n├── pooleparty\n│   ├── __inline__\n│   ├── __link__\n│   ├── _base.pre.scss\n│   ├── ...\n│   └── _type.pre.scss\n├── mixins.scss\n├── my-inline.scss\n├── my-style.scss\n├── syntax.scss\n└── variables.scss\n\n\nThe style rules are organized alongside components (or rather, topics) like “sidebar” and “footer”.\nFurther, there are two separate frameworks, “pooleparty” and “deepdive”,\nwhich grew out of the original Poole and Hyde projects.\nPoole/party contains more general style rules, while Hyde/jack contains those that more are specific to the theme.\nHowever, this separation has blurred over time.\n\nInside those folders, you will notice the __inline__ and __link__ folders.\nThe unfriendly names are intentional, because their contents are generated by a script and shouldn’t be modified directly.\nThe source files are located in the same folder and end with .pre.scss.\nThey are fully valid SCSS files, but contain comments that mark which lines should be inlined and which should be fetched asynchronously.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n\n  Every line between // &lt;&lt;&lt; inline and // &gt;&gt;&gt; will be inlined\n  Every line between // &lt;&lt;&lt; link and // &gt;&gt;&gt; will be linked\n  Every line that isn’t contained in a block and ends with // inline will be inlined\n  Every line that isn’t contained in a block and ends with // link will be linked\n  Every line for which none of the above applies will be included in both.\n\n\nThe actual splitting happen with the .scripts/build-css.sh script (requires node.js 8+).\nYou can run the script once by using\n\nnpm run build:css\n\n\nor rebuild the CSS on every file change\n\nnpm run watch:css\n\n\nNote that my-inline.scss and my-style.scss are not affected by this.\nAlso, since all files are valid SCSS, the splitting part is entirely optional.\nIf you would like to build just one regular CSS file, add\n\ndeepdive:\n  no_inline_css: true\n\n\nto your config file.\n\n",

You can provide an image attribute in in the front matter of posts, pages, and projects* that will be used by DeepDive in a variety of ways,\nsuch as header image in the blog and post layout, social media previews, cards in the gird and projects layout*, thumbnails in the search dropdown*, etc.\n\nThe image attribute will accept an URL to an image, but it is recommended that you provide a path / srcset hash instead, e.g.\n\nimage:\n  path:    /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2.jpg\n  srcset:\n    1920w: /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2.jpg\n    960w:  /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,5x.jpg\n    480w:  /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,25x.jpg\n\n\nDeepDive will show the image in various sizes depending on available screen width so that no specific size will fit all.\nInstead, I recommend using a mipmap-like approach, providing the image in multiple sizes, each image half the width of the previous one.\nSince DeepDive provides an appropriate sizes attribute, the browser can chose the best image from the provided source set.\n\nIf you have ImageMagick installed, you can use the following commands to create images at 50%, 25%, and 12.5% of the original image.\nOther image tools will provide similar capabilities.\n\nconvert your-image.jpg -resize 50% -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip -quality 85 -interlace JPEG -colorspace RGB your-image@0,5x.jpg\nconvert your-image.jpg -resize 25% -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip -quality 85 -interlace JPEG -colorspace RGB your-image@0,25x.jpg\nconvert your-image.jpg -resize 12.5% -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip -quality 85 -interlace JPEG -colorspace RGB your-image@0,125x.jpg\n\n\nNote that the keys in the srcset hash have to be valid “descriptors” (as defined here). In practice this means the width in pixels followed by w.\n\nThe path key is a fallback image for browsers that don’t support the srcset attribute. It’s also used by jekyll-seo-tag for social media previews.\n\nFor more information on srcset, see the documentation at MDN, or this article from CSS-Tricks.\n\nAdding an entry to the sidebar\n\nTo add links to the sidebar, populate the menu entry in _config.yml with a list of title-url pairs, e.g.:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nmenu:\n  - title: Blog\n    url:   /blog/\n  - title: Projects\n    url:   /projects/\n  - title: Resume\n    url:   /resume/\n  - title: About\n    url:   /about/\n\n\nAdding a link to an external page to the sidebar\n\nTo add links to external sites, simply provide a fully qualified URL, e.g.\n\nmenu:\n  - title: \"@qwtel\"\n    url:   https://qwtel.com/\n\n\nAdding a category or tag\n\nDeepDive allows you to use the list or grid* layout to show all posts of a particular category or tag.\n\nBefore you start, make sure your config files contains the features_categories and featured_tags collections:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ncollections:\n  featured_categories:\n    permalink:         /:name/\n    output:            true\n  featured_tags:\n    permalink:         /tag-:name/\n    output:            true\n\n\nRecap: Categories and tags in Jekyll\n\nPosts in Jekyll can belong to one or more categories, as well as one or more tags. They are defined in a post’s front matter:\n\n---\nlayout:     post\ntitle:      Welcome to Jekyll\ncategories: [jekyll, update]\ntags:       [jekyll, update]\n---\n\n\nPosts can also be assigned to a category based on their position within the folder structure, e.g.\n\n├── jekyll\n│   └── update\n│       └── _posts\n│           └── 2017-04-07-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown\n\n\nThis will place “Welcome to Jekyll” in the categories jekyll and update.\n\nThis is now the preferred way of assigning categories in DeepDive, as it makes URLs correspond more naturally to the underlying folder structure.\n\nWhether you use this method or not, categories will always be part of a posts URL, while tags will not.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Type\n      URL\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Categories\n      /jekyll/update/2017-04-07-welcome-to-jekyll/\n    \n    \n      Tags\n      /2017-04-07-welcome-to-jekyll/\n    \n  \n\n\nAs far as Jekyll is concerned, this is the only difference.\n\nCategories and tags in DeepDive\n\nCategories and tags are displayed by DeepDive below the title, after the date. Categories are displayed with the preposition “in”, while tags are displayed with the preposition “on”, e.g.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Type\n      Title\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Categories\n      Welcome to Jekyll¬ 07 Apr 2017 in Jekyll / Update\n    \n    \n      Tags\n      Welcome to Jekyll¬ 07 Apr 2017 on Jekyll, Update\n    \n    \n      Both\n      Welcome to Jekyll¬ 07 Apr 2017 in Jekyll / Update on Jekyll, Update\n    \n  \n\n\nYou can adjust these in _data/string.yml.\n\nCreating a new category or tag\n\nBy default, categories and tags are rendered as plain text. Further steps are necessary if you want them to link to a page that contains a list of all posts that belong to that category or tag.\n\nFor each featured category or tag, a file called &lt;category-name&gt;.md or &lt;tag-name&gt;.md has to be created inside the _featured_tags and _featured_categories folders, respectively. Each file in these folders is part of a Jekyll Collection.\n\nThe meta data of a category or tag is set in the files front matter, e.g.\n\n# file: `_featured_categories/hyde.md`\n---\nlayout: list\ntitle:  Hyde\nslug:   hyde\ndescription: &gt;\n  Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme.\n  It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.\n---\n\n\n\n  layout\n  Must either list or grid*\n  title\n  Used as title of the page, as well as name of the category or tag as part of the line below a blog post’s title. Can be different from the name of the tag or category, as long as slug is identical to the name.\n  slug\n  Must be identical to the key used in the blog’s front matter, i.e. if you use categories: [jekyll] the slug must be jekyll. By default, the slug is derived from the title, but here it is recommended that you set it explicitly.\n  description\n  A medium-length description, used on the tag or category’s detail page and shown in a message box below the title.\n  menu\n  Set to to true if you want the category or tag to appear in the sidebar. For more information, see Adding an entry to the sidebar.\n\n\nOnce the file is created, the page can be found at /category/&lt;categoryname&gt;/ or /tag/&lt;tagname&gt;/.\n\nAdding an about page\n\nAbout pages are a frequent use case, so DeepDive has a special layout for it. It is a slight modification of the page layout that allows showing the author information by adding the &lt;!--author--&gt; marker somewhere on the page.\n\nTo create an about page, make sure layout is set to about.\nFor more on authors, see Adding an author.\n\n&lt;!-- file: `about.md` --&gt;\n---\nlayout: about\ntitle:  About\n---\n\nSome content\n\n&lt;!--author--&gt;\n\n\nAdding a cover page\n\nDeepDive 8 introduces cover pages, i.e. pages witht he sidebar opened, so that it spans the entire screen. This feature is intended for landing pages. To enable it on a page, simply add cover: true to the front matter.\n\n\n\n# file: `index.md`\n---\nlayout: welcome\ntitle:  Welcome\ncover:  true #!! Add this\n---\n\n\nAdding related posts to a post\n\nYou can choose which posts will appear in the “Related Posts” section below a post by adding the related_posts key to the front matter of a post\n\n# file: `category/_posts/2020-02-01-some-post.md`\n---\nlayout: post\nrelated_posts:\n  # Specify via the path in the file system\n  - category/_posts/2020-01-01-other-post.md\n  # Can also use the url of the post,\n  # but this will break when changing the `permalink` setting!\n  - /blog/category/2020-01-02-other-other-post/\n---\n\n\nCustomization\n\nAdding custom CSS\n\nThe quickest and safest way to add custom CSS to DeepDive is via the _sass/my-inline.scss and _sass/my-style.scss files (create the folder/the files if they don’t exist).\n\nTo add CSS that gets inlined into the page, i.e. is loaded with the first request, put the CSS rules into my-inline.scss. This is intended for above-the-fold content. Otherwise put the CSS rules into my-style.scss.\nNote that this distinction has no effect when no_inline_css is enabled.\n\nAdding custom HTML to the head\n\nTo add custom HTML elements to the &lt;head&gt; of the document, open _includes/my-head.html (create the folder/the files if they don’t exist) and add your elements there.\n\nAdding custom HTML to the body\n\nTo add custom HTML elements to the &lt;body&gt; of the document, open _includes/my-body.html (create the folder/the files if they don’t exist) and add your elements there.\n\n\n  What’s the difference to my-scripts.html?\n  This file was used in earlier versions of DeepDive to accomplish the same goal. However, there are still instances were you might want to prefer my-scripts.html over my-body.html, as it won’t load scrips on redirect pages and will be ignored by browsers &lt; IE10.\n\n\nAdding a welcome page*\n\nIt is intended to showcase your projects and blog posts in a compact way.\nTechnically, it is a modified version of the about layout, so it allows showing the author information where the &lt;!--author--&gt; marker is put. Demo.\n\nYou can create a welcome page by creating a new markdown file and setting the layout to welcome in the front matter.\n\n# file: `index.md`\n---\nlayout: welcome\ntitle:  Welcome\ncover:  true\n---\n\n\nWithout further configuration, the welcome page will just look like a regular page. However, it can be enhanced through the use of markers:\n\n\n  To show the two most recent projects, add the &lt;!--projects--&gt; marker to the content\n  To show the four most recent blog posts, add the &lt;!--posts--&gt; marker to the content\n  (To show the five most recent blog posts in list form, add the &lt;!--posts_list--&gt; marker to the content)\n\n\nThe welcome layout also supports selecting specific projects and posts, by adding to the front matter, e.g.:\n\n# file: `index.md`\n---\nselected_projects:\n  - _projects/hydejack-v6.md\n  - /projects/hyde-v2/\nprojects_page: projects.md\nselected_posts:\n  - _posts/2017-05-03-javascripten.md\n  - /blog/2012-02-07-example-content/\nposts_page: /blog/\nfeatured: false\n---\n\n\n\n  selected_projects\n  A list of paths to projects that should be featured in the &lt;!--projects--&gt; marker.\nEither provide paths relative to the main directory with no leading /,\nor URLs according to the schema defined in permalink.\n  projects_page\n  The path to the main projects page\nEither a path relative to the main directory with no leading ./,\nor a URL according to the schema defined in permalink.\n  selected_posts\n  A list of paths to blog posts that should be featured in the &lt;!--posts--&gt; or &lt;!--posts_list--&gt; marker.\nEither provide paths relative to the main directory with no leading /,\nor URLs according to the schema defined in permalink.\n  posts_page\n  The path to the main posts page.\nEither a path relative to the main directory with no leading ./,\nor a URL according to the schema defined in permalink.\n  featured\n  Optional. When true, project thumbnails will span the full width instead of half.\nThis setting takes precedence over the featured value of individual projects,\ni.e. it will apply to the entire page.\n\n\nProjects*\n\nAdding a projects page\n\nThe projects page will show all projects of a particular collection.\n\nFirst, you need to make sure that you have the projects collection defined in _config.yml:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ncollections:\n  projects:\n    permalink: /projects/:path/\n    output:    true\n\n\nNext, add a projects.md to in the root (you can adjust the name/location to match the permalink of the\ncollection).\nThis file has the projects layout (mind the “s” at the end) and should have a show_collection key,\nwith the name of the collection as a value, e.g.:\n\n# file: `projects.md`\n---\nlayout:          projects\ntitle:           Projects*\nshow_collection: projects\nfeatured:        true\n---\n\n\n\n  layout\n  Must be projects.\n  title\n  The title of the page. Note that this name is reused as part of each individual project page\n(for the link that directs back to the projects page).\n  show_collection\n  The name of the collection you want display on this page. Defaults to projects. See Organizing Projects for detail on how to handle multiple project collections.\n  featured\n  Optional. When true, project thumbnails will span the full width, instead of only half.\nThis setting takes precedence over the featured value of individual projects,\ni.e. it will apply to the entire page.\n\n\nAdding a project\n\nProjects are organized using Jekyll Collections.\nEach project generates an entry on the projects layout (Demo) as well as its own detail page (Demo).\n\nEach project is defined by a file in the _projects directory.\nThe project’s meta information is defined in the file’s front matter. You can also add markdown content.\nA project’s front matter should look like:\n\n# file: `_projects/hyde-v2.md`\n---\nlayout:      project\ntitle:       Hyde v2*\ndate:        2 Jan 2014\nimage:\n  path:       /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,25x.jpg\n  srcset:\n    1920w:   /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2.jpg\n    960w:    /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,5x.jpg\n    480w:    /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,25x.jpg\ncaption:     Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme.\ndescription: &gt;\n  Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme.\n  It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.\nlinks:\n  - title:   Demo\n    url:     http://hyde.getpoole.com\n  - title:   Source\n    url:     https://github.com/poole/hyde\nfeatured:    false\n---\n\n\n\n  layout\n  Must be set to project\n  date\n  Providing a year is the minimum requirement. Used to sort the projects.\n  image\n  A 16:9 image of the project. See Adding images for details.\n  caption\n  A short description, shown as part of each “project card” in the projects layout.\n  description\n  A medium-length description, used on the project’s detail page as meta description and shown as message box below the image.\n  links\n  A list of title-url pairs that link to external resources related to this project.\n  author\n  Optional. The author shown below the project, similar to posts.\n  featured\n  Optional. When true, the project preview will span the full content width. You can use this for projects that should receive more attention. You can set/override this for an entire page, by setting featured in the front matter (applies to the projects and welcome layout).\n\n\nOrganizing Projects\n\nIf you want to organize your projects using categories or tags, similar to the way you do with posts, the best way is to achieve this is via multiple collections. Categories and tags are reserved for posts, and adding them to collections has no effect.\n\nThe default config file comes with one projects collection predefined, but we can easily add additional collections like so:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ncollections:\n  # The default projects collection\n  projects:\n    permalink:         /projects/:path/\n    output:            true\n\n  # Our new projects collection\n  other_projects:\n    # Make sure the permalink path is different!\n    permalink:         /other-projects/:path/\n    output:            true\n\n\nCreate a new folder in the top level directory that follows the naming convention _&lt;collection name&gt;. In our case the name is _other_projects.\nIn it, create collection items as shown above.\n\nThis is enough to render the project pages. To render them all on a single page, create a projects page as described above with the show_collection key set to our new collection, e.g.:\n\n# file: \"other-collection.md\"\n---\nlayout: projects\ntitle: Other Projects*\nshow_collection: other_projects #!!\n---\n\n\nNote that the file name matches the other-projects path in the permalink we’ve defined above. This is to ensure that the directories match up.\n\nAdding a resume*\n\nDemo.\n\nIt generates the resume page from a valid JSON Resume, which is good news if you already have a JSON resume. Otherwise, there are various ways of obtaining one:\n\n\n  You can edit the example resume.yml in _data directly. It contains example entries for each type of entry.\n  You can use the visual JSON Resume Editor.\n  If you have a LinkedIn profile, you can try LinkedIn to Json Résumé.\n\n\nOnce you have a JSON Resume, place it into _data.\n\nTo render a resume page, create a new markdown file and set the layout to resume in the front matter:\n\n# file: `resume.md`\n---\nlayout: resume\ntitle:  Resume\ndescription: &gt;\n  A short description of the page for search engines (~150 characters long).\nhide_description: true\n---\n\n\nYou can download the final resume.json (minified) from the assets folder. When running locally, you can find it at _site/assets/resume.json.\n\nChanging the layout\n\nYou can customize the layout of the resume by rearranging the entries in the left_column and right_columns keys in the front matter, e.g.\n\n# file: `resume.md`\n---\nlayout: resume\nleft_column:\n  - work\n  - volunteer\n  - education\n  - awards\n  - publications\n  - references\nright_column:\n  - languages\n  - skills\n  - interests\n---\n\n\nSkill level icons\n\nBy default, the layout will replace certain keywords with star icons. The keywords are as follows:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Icon\n      Skills\n      Languages\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      3/3, Master, Expert, Senior, Professional\n      5/5, Native or bilingual proficiency, Native speaker\n    \n    \n      \n       \n      4/5, Full professional proficiency\n    \n    \n      \n      2/3, Intermediate, Advanced, Amateur\n      3/5, Professional working proficiency\n    \n    \n      \n       \n      2/5, Limited working proficiency\n    \n    \n      \n      1/3, Beginner, Novice, Junior\n      1/5, Elementary proficiency\n    \n    \n      \n      0/3\n      0/5, No proficiency\n    \n  \n\n\nIf a keyword is not recognized, the provided text will be spelled out  instead. To disable icons and always spell out the text,  set no_skill_icons and/or no_langauge_icons to true.\n\n# file: `resume.md`\nno_language_icons: true\nno_skill_icons: true\n\n\nAdding a specialized resume or multiple resumes\n\nYou can add a specialized resume or multiple resumes by adding the resume YAML to the front matter under the resume key.\nE.g.:\n\n# file: `resume.md`\n---\nlayout: resume\ntitle:  Resume\ndescription: &gt;\n  A short description of the page for search engines (~150 characters long).\nresume:\n  basics:\n    name: \"Richard Hendricks\"\n    label: \"Programmer\"\n    picture: \"/assets/icons/icon.png\"\n  # ...\n---\n\n\nDownloads\n\nYou can add buttons to let readers print or download your resume in various formats.\nAdd the following to the front matter to add all 4 buttons:\n\n# file: \"resume.md\"\nbuttons:\n  print: true\n  pdf: /assets/Resume.pdf\n  vcf: http://h2vx.com/vcf/&lt;!--url--&gt;\n  json: /assets/resume.json\n\n\nTo remove a button remove the corresponding key from the hash.\n\nWhile the resume.json is can be generated by Jekyll itself, and the vCard can be generated by an external service,\nthe PDF needs to be pre-generated by you.\n\nYou can render a PDF from the resume page itself by using your browser’s “Print to PDF” feature (Chrome works best).\nFor best results, check the following options in the print popup:\n\n\n\nContinue with Writing\n\n",

Building itself happens via Jekyll’s build command.\n\nJEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build\n\n\nThis will generate the finished static files in _site,\nwhich can be deployed using the methods outlined in the Jekyll Documentation.\n\nBuilding locally with latent semantic analysis\n\nBy default, related posts are simply the most recent posts.\nDeepDive modifies this a bit, by showing the most recent posts of the same category or tag.\nHowever, the results are still pretty “unrelated”.\nTo provide better results, Jekyll supports latent semantic analysis via classifier-reborn’s\nLatent Semantic Indexer\n\nTo use the LSI, you first have to disable DeepDive’s default behavior,\nby setting use_lsi: true under the deepdive key in your config file.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndeepdive:\n  use_lsi: true\n\n\nThen, you have to run jekyll build with the --lsi flag:\n\nJEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build --lsi\n\n\nNote that this may take a long time.\nOnce it is finished, the generated static files will be located in the _site directory,\nwhich can be deployed using the methods outlined in the Jekyll Documentation.\n\nGitHub Pages\n\nIf you’re using the Starter Kit for GitHub pages, all you have to do is push your repository:\n\ngit add .\ngit commit \"Update\"\ngit push origin master\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This chapter covers the many configuration options of DeepDive, allowing you to tailor it to your needs.\n",
      "content": "Once Jekyll is running, you can start with basic configuration by adding various entries to _config.yml.\nBesides the documentation here, you can also read the annotated config file.\n\nWhen making changes to _config.yml, it is necessary to restart the Jekyll process for changes to take effect.\n\n\n  Setting url and baseurl    \n      GitHub Pages\n    \n  \n  Changing accent colors and sidebar images    \n      Theme color\n    \n  \n  Changing fonts    \n      Removing Google Fonts\n    \n  \n  Choosing a blog layout    \n      Using the blog layout in a subdirectory\n    \n  \n  Adding an author    \n      Adding an author’s picture\n      Adding social media icons\n      Adding an email, RSS icon or download icon\n    \n  \n  Enabling comments\n  Enabling Google Analytics    \n      Using a custom analytics provider\n    \n  \n  Changing built-in strings\n  Adding legal documents\n  Enabling math blocks\n  Adding custom Favicons and App Icons    \n      Changing the Favicon\n      Changing the App Icons\n    \n  \n  Adding a cookies banner*\n  Enabling newsletter boxes*\n  Enabling Dark Mode*\n\n\nSetting url and baseurl\n\nThe first order of business should be to set the correct url and baseurl values in _config.yml.\n\nThe url is the domain of your site, including the protocol (http or https). For this site, it is\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nurl: https://qwtel.com\n\n\nYou don’t need to provide this property when hosting on GitHub Pages or Netlify.\n\nIf your entire Jekyll blog is hosted in a subdirectory of your page, provide the path in baseurl with a leading /, but no trailing /,\ne.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nbaseurl: /deepdive\n\n\nOtherwise, provide the empty string ''\n\nYou don’t need to provide this property when hosting on GitHub Pages or Netlify.\n\nGitHub Pages\n\nWhen hosting on GitHub Pages the url is https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io\n(unless you are using a custom domain).\n\nThe baseurl depends on the kind of page you are hosting.\n\n\n  When hosting a user or organization page, use the empty string ''.\n  When hosting project page, use /&lt;reponame&gt;.\n\n\nFor for information on the types of pages you can host on GitHub, see the\nGitHub Help article.\n\nChanging accent colors and sidebar images\n\nDeepDive allows you to choose the background image of the sidebar, as well as the accent color\n(color of the links, selection and focus outline, etc…).\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\naccent_image: /assets/img/sidebar/bg.jpg\naccent_color: rgb(79,177,186)\n\n\nI recommend using a blurred image in order for the text to remain readable.\nIf you save a blurred image as JPG, it will also drastically reduce its file size.\n\nThe accent_image property also accepts the special value none which will remove the default image.\n\nIf your sidebar image contains bright colors, the white text can be difficult to read. In this case, consider setting\ninvert_sidebar: true in the front matter to invert the text colors in the sidebar.\nUse front matter defaults to enable this on all pages (see below).\n\nNote that these values can be overwritten on a per-page basis, i.e. you can create a unique look for each page.\nYou can also apply a certain look to all posts in a category via front matter defaults, e.g.:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      path:         deepdive/\n    values:\n      accent_image: /assets/img/hydejack-bg.jpg\n      accent_color: rgb(38,139,210)\n\n\nTheme color\n\nDeepDive also supports the theme_color property. When set, it will change the background color of the sidebar, as well as set the theme_color property in the Web App Manifest. In some browsers, such as Chrome on Android, this will change the color of the browser’s UI components.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ntheme_color:  rgb(25,55,71)\n\n\nJust like accent_* properties, the theme color can be overridden on a per-page basis by setting it in the front matter.\n\nChanging fonts\n\nDeepDive lets you configure the font of regular text and headlines, and it has built-in support for Google Fonts.\nThere are three keys in _config.yml associated with this: font, font_heading and google_fonts.\nThe defaults are:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nfont:         Noto Sans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\nfont_heading: Roboto Slab, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\ngoogle_fonts: Roboto+Slab:700|Noto+Sans:400,400i,700,700i\n\n\nfont and font_heading must be valid CSS font-family values. When using Google Fonts make sure to provide at least one fallback.\n\nThe google_fonts key is the string necessary to fetch the fonts from Google.\nYou can get it from the download page at Google Fonts after you’ve selected one or more fonts:\n\n\n\nRemoving Google Fonts\n\nIf you prefer not to use Google Fonts and remove all associated code from the site,\nset the google_fonts key to false.\n\nThe no_google_fonts parameter has been removed in v9 and no longer has any effect.\n\nChoosing a blog layout\n\nDeepDive features three layouts for showing your blog posts.\n\n\n  The list layout only shows the title and groups the posts by year of publication.\n  The grid layout* will show a content card (with image) for each post.\n  The blog layout is a traditional paginated layout and shows the title and an excerpt of each post.\n\n\nIn order to use the list or grid layout add the following front-matter to a new markdown file:\n\n---\nlayout: list # or `grid`\ntitle:  Home\n---\n\n\nIf you want to use the blog layout, you need to add jekyll-paginate to your Gemfile and to the plugins list in your config file:\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"jekyll-paginate\"\n\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n\n\nYou also need to add the paginate and paginate_path keys to your config file, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\npaginate:      10\npaginate_path: '/:num/'\n\n\nThe blog layout needs to be applied to a file with the .html file extension\nand the paginate_path needs to match the path to the index.html file.\nTo match the paginate_path above, put a index.html with the following front matter in the root directory:\n\n# file: `index.html`\n---\nlayout: blog\ntitle: Blog\n---\n\n\nFor more information see Pagination.\n\nUsing the blog layout in a subdirectory\n\nIf you want to use the blog layout at a URL like /my-blog/, create the following folder structure:\n\n├── my-blog\n│   └── index.html\n└── _config.yml\n\n\nYou can use the same index.html as before and place it in the subdirectory.\n\n# file: `my-blog/index.html`\n---\nlayout: blog\ntitle: Blog\n---\n\n\nIn your config file, make sure the paginate_path matches the name of the subdirectory:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\npaginate:      10\npaginate_path: /my-blog/:num/ #!!\n\n\nTo add an entry in the sidebar to your blog directory, see Adding an entry to the sidebar.\n\nAdding an author\n\nAt a bare minimum, you should add an author key with a name and email sub-key\n(used by the feed plugin) to to your config file:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  name:  Florian Klampfer\n  email: mail@qwtel.com\n\n\nIf you would like the author to be displayed in the about section below a post or project*, add an about key and provide markdown content. I recommend using the YAML pipe | syntax, so you can include multiple paragraphs:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  name:  Florian Klampfer\n  email: mail@qwtel.com\n  about: |\n    Hi, I'm Florian or @qwtel...\n\n    This is another paragraph.\n\n\nAdding an author’s picture\n\nIf you’d like for the author’s picture to appear in addition the about text (see above), you can either use the jekyll-avatar plugin or provide URLs to images manually.\n\nTo use the plugin, add it to your Gemfile and the list of plugins in your config file:\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"jekyll-avatar\"\n\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-avatar\n\n\nRun bundle install for the changes to take effect.\n\nMake sure you have provided a GitHub username in your config file (github_username),\nor to the author key (author.social.github, author.github.username, or author.github).\nSee Adding social media icons for more.\n\nTo set an image manually, you have to provide an URL to the author’s picture key:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  picture:  /assets/img/me.jpg\n\n\nIf you’d like to provide multiple versions for screens with different pixel densities,\nyou can provide path and srcset keys instead:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  picture:\n    path:   /assets/img/me.jpg\n    srcset:\n      1x:   /assets/img/me.jpg\n      2x:   /assets/img/me@2x.jpg\n\n\nThe keys of the srcset hash will be used as image descriptors. For more information on srcset, see the documentation at MDN, or this article from CSS-Tricks.\n\nAdding social media icons\n\nDeepDive supports a variety of social media icons out of the box. These are defined on a per-author basis, so make sure you’ve followed the steps in Adding an author.\n\nIf you are using the gem-based version of DeepDive, download social.yml and put it into _data in the root directory. This is necessary because gem-based themes do not support including _data.\n\nYou can add a link to a social network by adding an entry to the social key in to an author.\nIt consists of the name of the social network as key and your username within that network as value, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    twitter: qwtel\n    github:  qwtel\n\n\nCheck out authors.yml to see which networks are available.\nYou can also follow the steps here to add your own social media icons.\n\nYou can change the order in which the icons appear by moving lines up or down, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    github:  qwtel # now github appears first\n    twitter: qwtel\n\n\nTo get an overview of which networks are available and how a typical username in that network looks like,\nsee the included authors.yml.\n\nShould providing a username not produce a correct link for some reason, you can provide a complete URL instead, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu0PYX_kVANdmgIZ4bw6_kA\n\n\nYou can add any platform, even if it’s not defined in social.yml, by providing a complete URL. However, a fallback icon  will be used when no icon is available. Supplying your own icons is an advanced topic.\n\nAdding an email, RSS icon or download icon\n\nIf you’d like to add an email , RSS , or download  icon to the list, add the email, rss, or download key, e.g.:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nauthor:\n  social:\n    email:    mail@qwtel.com\n    rss:      https://www.jv-conseil.net/feed.xml # make sure you provide an absolute URL\n    download: https://github.com/hydecorp/deepdive/archive/v9.1.6.zip\n\n\nEnabling comments\n\nDeepDive supports comments via Disqus. Before you can add comments to a page you need to register and add your site to Disqus’ admin console. Once you have obtained your “Disqus shortname”, you include it in your config file:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndisqus: &lt;disqus shortname&gt;\n\n\nNow comments can be enabled by adding comments: true to the front matter.\n\n---\nlayout:   post\ntitle:    Hello World\ncomments: true\n---\n\n\nYou can enable comments for entire classes of pages by using front matter defaults.\nE.g. to enable comments on all posts, add to your config file:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      comments: true\n\n\nEnabling Google Analytics\n\nEnabling Google Analytics is as simple as setting the google_analytics key.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ngoogle_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X\n\n\nTo remove Google Analytics and all associated code from the site, set the google_analytics key to false.\n\nUsing a custom analytics provider\n\nIf you want to use a different analytics provider such as Matomo, you can add its code snippet to _includes/my-body.html (create if it doesn’t exist).\nThe default file contains an example.\n\nChanging built-in strings\n\nYou can change the wording of built-in strings like “Related Posts” or “Read more” in _data/strings.yml.\n\nIf you are using the gem-based version the file doesn’t exist, but you can get the default file here.\n\nYou will frequently find markers like &lt;!--post_title--&gt;.\nYou can place them freely within your string and they will be replaced with the content they refer to.\n\nYou may also use this feature to translate the theme into different languages.\nIn this case you should also set the lang key to your config file, e.g.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nlang: cc-ll\n\n\nwhere cc is the 2-letter country code and ll specifies a 2-letter location code, e.g.: de-at.\n\nYou may also change the strings used for formatting dates and times (look out for the date_formats key), but be aware that the values you provide need to be valid Ruby format directives.\n\nAdding legal documents\n\nIf you have pages for contact data, privacy policy, cookie policy, etc. you can add links to them in the footer by listing them under the legal key in your config file as follows:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nlegal:\n  - title: Impress\n    url:  /impress/\n  - title: Cookies Policy\n    url:  /cookies-policy/\n\n\nWhen using DeepDive’s offline feature, the pages listed here will be downloaded and cached when loading the page for the first time.\n\nEnabling math blocks\n\nDeepDive supports math blocks with either KaTeX or MathJax.\n\nThe MathJax implementation comes with a client-side runtime and works on GitHub Pages.\nIt is the more heavy-weight of the two and doesn’t work without JavaScript enabled.\nDue to the size of the complete MathJax package, it only works partially with offline support enabled.\n\nThe KaTeX implementation pre-renders the KaTeX output during site building.\nIt’s more lightweight because it does not ship a client-side runtime and therefore works without JavaScript.\nIn my opinion, it is the more elegant solution, but it requires a JavaScript runtime on the machine that builds the site,\ni.e. it does not work on GitHub Pages.\n\nYou can switch between the two implementations by changing the kramdown.math_engine key to either katex or mathjax in your config file.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\nkramdown:\n  math_engine:         katex\n  math_engine_opts:    {}\n\n\nThe KaTeX implementation also requires the kramdown-math-katex gem in your Gemfile.\nIf you intend to use MathJax instead, this step is not required.\n\n# file: `Gemfile`\ngem \"kramdown-math-katex\"\n\n\nThere are a couple of things to know about this gem:\n\n\n  It is not supported on GitHub Pages.\n You have to build the site on your machine before uploading to GitHub,\n or use a more permissive cloud building tool such as Netlify.\n  You need some kind of JavaScript runtime on your machine.\n Usually installing NodeJS will suffice.\n Alternatively, adding gem \"duktape\" will also do.\n For more, see https://github.com/kramdown/math-katex#documentation\n\n\nBefore you add math content, remember to run bundle install and restart Jekyll.\n\nAdding custom Favicons and App Icons\n\nChanging the Favicon\n\nBy default, DeepDive will use the Favicon from /assets/icons/favicon.ico and Apple Touch Icon from /assets/icons/icon-192x192.png.\nYou can either override these files, or override the path in the config file via favicon and app_touch_icon keys:\n\n# file: \"_config.yml\"\nfavicon: /favicon.ico\napple_touch_icon: /assets/img/logo.png\n\n\nChanging the App Icons\n\nBy default, DeepDive includes its own favicon, as well as app icons in 8 different resolutions.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Resolution\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      icon-512x512.png\n      512x512\n    \n    \n      icon-384x384.png\n      384x384\n    \n    \n      icon-192x192.png\n      192x192\n    \n    \n      icon-152x152.png\n      152x152\n    \n    \n      icon-144x144.png\n      144x144\n    \n    \n      icon-128x128.png\n      128x128\n    \n    \n      icon-96x96.png\n      96x96\n    \n    \n      icon-72x72.png\n      72x72\n    \n  \n\n\nTo change the default icons you have to replce all of them. To make this manageable, I recommend using the following tools:\n\nFirst, use the Maskable.app Editor to confine your logo/picture to the “minimum safe area”. More on maskable app icons, see this article on web.dev.\nMake sure the base image is at least 512x512 pixels in size.\n\nThen use the Web App Manifest Generator to automatically resize the icons.\nUpload the icon downloaded from Maskable.app and then click “Generate .zip”.\nIn the zip, ignore the manifest.json and look for the icons folder. Copy it into the assets folder of your site.\n\nTo change the favicon, place your own favicon.ico (32x32, PNG) into assets/icons.\n\nAdding a cookies banner*\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndeepdive:\n  cookies_banner: true\n\n\nEnabling this setting will show a notice at the top of the page to new visitors.\nYou can change the wording of the notice in _data/strings.yml\nwith the cookies_banner.text and cookies_banner.okay keys:\n\n# file: `_data/strings.yml`\ncookies_banner:\n  text: This site uses cookies. [Markdown allowed](/cookies-policy/)!\n  okay: Okay\n\n\nEnabling newsletter boxes*\n\nTo enable showing newsletter subscription boxes below each post and project,\nprovide your Tinyletter username to the tinyletter key in the config file.\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ntinyletter:  &lt;tinyletter username&gt;\n\n\nTo edit the content of the newsletter box, open _data/strings.yml, and change the entries under the tinyletter key.\n\nIf want to use a different mailing provider you can build your own form, and insert it into _includes/my-newsletter.html. The file includes an example form for MailChimp, where you need to fill in site.mailchimp.action and site.mailchimp.hidden_input (you can get these from MailChimp).\n\nTo build a completely new from, you can use the same CSS classes as Bootstrap. Note that only form, grid and utility classes are available. Check out Forms by Example for more examples.\n\nEnabling Dark Mode*\n\nDark-themed version of DeepDive.\n\nDark mode can be enabled in config.yml under the deepdive key and has three settings and two adjustments:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndeepdive:\n  dark_mode:\n    dynamic: true\n    sunrise: 6\n    sunset:  18\n    icon:    true\n    always:  false\n\n\nSetting dynamic, will enable dark mode based on the client’s local time (unlike location-based sunset calculations, this approach does not require a permission form the user). You can adjust sunrise and sunset to change when to show the light/dark theme.\n\nSetting icon will show a switch to alternate between the light and dark mode at the top of the page.\n\nFinally, setting always will cause dark mode to become the default theme at all times (combine with dynamic: false).\n\nContinue with Basics\n\n",

A lot of patterns and names have changed, motivated by a variety of reasons, including better integration with the rest of the Jekyll ecosystem and simplified workflows enabled by Jekyll Collections.\n\n\n  From v5    \n      Updating the folder structure\n      Updating the configuration\n      Restoring the tags\n      Restoring the sidebar entries\n      Restoring the RSS feed\n      Restoring the comments\n      Restoring the about page\n    \n  \n\n\nFrom v5\n\nUpdating the folder structure\n\nCopy the following folders and files from DeepDive v6 into your existing repository. Make sure you merge the folder contents.\n\n\n  _data/\n  _includes/\n  _layouts/\n  _sass/\n  assets/\n  index.html (index.md*)\n  Gemfile\n  Gemfile.lock\n\n\nNote that the public folder has been renamed to assets.\nYou’ll want to move your static assets there.\n\nUpdating the configuration\n\n_config.yml has changed considerably.

If you want to add a tag, open _featured_tags/&lt;tagname&gt;.md.\n  Add menu: true to its front matter.\n  (Optional) Set order: &lt;number&gt;, where &lt;number&gt; is the number at which you would like the link to appear.\n\n\nRestoring the RSS feed\n\nThe feed is now provided by the jekyll-feed plugin instead of a custom solution.\n\n\n  Delete atom.xml\n  \n    Add - jekyll-feed to gems in _config.yml, e.g.\n\n     gems:\n   - jekyll-seo-tag\n   - jekyll-feed\n    \n  \n  \n    (Optional) Add the following to _config.yml to make the feed appear at the same URL as the old atom.xml.\n\n     feed:\n   path: atom.xml\n    \n  \n\n\nRestoring the comments\n\nThe way comments are enabled has changed slightly.\nYou now have to enable them per page by adding comments: true to the front matter\n(this is what the Disqus integration guide suggests).\nTo enable them for all posts, add to the config file\n\ndefaults:\n  - scope:\n      type: posts\n    values:\n      comments: true\n\n\nRestoring the about page\n\nDeepDive now has a dedicated layout for about pages.\nTo use it, open about.md and change the layout in the front matter to about\nand delete {% include about-short.html author=site.author %}.\n",

      "content": "There are two ways of adding third party scripts.\nEmbedding is ideal for one-off scripts, e.g. widgets.js that is part of embedded tweets (see below).\nAdding global scripts is for scripts that should be loaded on every page.\n\n\n  Embedding\n  Global scripts\n  Registering push state event listeners\n  If everything else fails\n\n\nEmbedding\n\nDeepDive supports embedding third party scripts directly inside markdown content. This will work in most cases, except when a script can not be loaded on a page more than once (this will occur when a user navigates to the same page twice).\n\nExample:\n\n&lt;script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\n    The next version of DeepDive (v6.3.0) will allow embedding 3rd party scripts,\n    like the one that comes with this tweet for example.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &amp;mdash; Florian Klampfer (@qwtel)\n  &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/qwtel/status/871098943505039362\"&gt;June 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n\n\nThe next version of DeepDive (v6.3.0) will allow embedding 3rd party scripts, like the one that comes with this tweet for example.&mdash; Florian Klampfer (@qwtel) June 3, 2017\n\nGlobal scripts\n\nIf you have scripts that should be included on every page you can add them globally by\nopening (or creating) _includes/my-scripts.html and adding them like you normally would:\n\n&lt;!-- file: `_includes/my-scripts.html` --&gt;\n&lt;script\n  src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-k2WSCIexGzOj3Euiig+TlR8gA0EmPjuc79OEeY5L45g=\"\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nmy-scripts.html will be included at the end of the body tag.\n\nRegistering push state event listeners\n\nWhen embedding scripts globally you might want to run some init code after each page load. However, the problem with push state-based page loads is that the load event won’t fire again. Luckily, DeepDive’s push state component exposes an event that you can listen to instead.\n\n&lt;!-- file: `_includes/my-scripts.html` --&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  document.getElementById('_pushState').addEventListener('hy-push-state-load', function() {\n    // &lt;your init code&gt;\n  });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nNote that the above code must only run once, so include it in your my-scripts.html.\n\n\n  hy-push-state-start\n  Occurs after clicking a link.\n  hy-push-state-ready\n  Animation fished and response has been parsed, ready to swap out the content.\n  hy-push-state-after\n  The old content has been replaced with the new content.\n  hy-push-state-progress\n  Special case when animation is finished, but no response from server has arrived yet.\nThis is when the loading spinner will appear.\n  hy-push-state-load\n  All embedded script tags have been inserted into the document and have finished loading.\n\n\nIf everything else fails\n\nIf you can’t make an external script work with DeepDive’s push state approach to page loading,\nyou can disable push state by adding to your config file:\n\n# file: `_config.yml`\ndeepdive:\n  no_push_state: true\n\n\nContinue with Build\n",

      "content": "Hydejack offers a few additional features to markup your content.\nDon’t worry, these are merely CSS classes added with kramdown’s {:...} syntax,\nso that your content remains compatible with other Jekyll themes.\n\n\n  A word on building speeds\n  Adding a table of contents\n  Adding notes\n  Adding large text\n  Adding large images\n  Adding image captions\n  Adding large quotes\n  Adding faded text\n  Adding tables    \n      Scroll table\n      Small tables\n    \n  \n  Adding code blocks\n  Adding math    \n      Inline\n      Block\n    \n  \n\n\nFor an introduction to markdown in general, see Mastering Markdown and kramdown Syntax.\n\nA word on building speeds\n\nIf building speeds are a problem, try using the --incremental flag, e.g.\n\nbundle exec jekyll serve --incremental\n\n\nFrom the Jekyll docs (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Enable the experimental incremental build feature. Incremental build only re-builds posts and pages that have changed, resulting in significant performance improvements for large sites, but may also break site generation in certain cases.\n\n\nThe breakage occurs when you create new files or change filenames.\nAlso, changing the title, category, tags, etc. of a page or post will not be reflected in pages\nother then the page or post itself.\nThis makes it ideal for writing new posts and previewing changes, but not setting up new content.\n\nAdding a table of contents\n\nYou can add a generated table of contents to any page by adding {:toc} below a list.\n\nMarkdown:\n\n* this unordered seed list will be replaced by the toc\n{:toc}\n\n\nYou can also create your table of contents as an ordered list (note the 1. instead of *):\n\n1. this ordered seed list will be replaced by the toc\n{:toc}\n\n\nThe width of the display has to be larger than 1665px for the ToC to become sticky.\nOtherwise, the ToC will appear where the seed list is placed in the document.\nTo show the table of contents only on large displays (&gt; 1665px) use the following:\n\n* this unordered seed list will be replaced by the toc\n{:toc .large-only}\n\n\nA sticky table of contents will reduce the amount of space freed up by the no_break_layout: false setting.\nThis is necessary to ensure large code blocks or tables don’t overlap with the ToC.\n\nAdding notes\n\nYou can add a note by adding the note class to a paragraph.\n\nExample:\n\nYou can add a note.\n\nMarkdown:\n\nYou can add a note.\n{:.note}\n\n\nEdit the note key in _data/strings.yml to change the wording of the default label.\nTo add a note with a specific label, add a title attribute:\n\nA custom label.\n{:.note title=\"Attention\"}\n\n\nA custom label.\n\nAdding large text\n\nYou can add large text by adding the lead class to the paragraph.\n\nExample:\n\nYou can add large text.\n\nMarkdown:\n\nYou can add large text.\n{:.lead}\n\n\nAdding large images\n\nYou can make an image span the full width by adding the lead class.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nMarkdown:\n\n![Full-width image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x100){:.lead width=\"800\" height=\"100\" loading=\"lazy\"}\n\n\nIt is recommended to provide the dimension of the image via the width and height attributes,\nso that browsers can calculate the layout before the images are loaded. Combining this with the loading=\"lazy\" attribute\nallows modern browsers to load the images just-in-time as the users scrolls.\n\nPrevious versions of Hydejack shipped with a custom JavaScript-based lazy loading solution,\nbut it has been removed in v9 in favor of this more standards-based approach.\n\nAdding image captions\n\nYou can add captions to large images by adding the figcaption class to the paragraph after the image:\n\n\n\nAn optional caption for an image.\n\nMarkdown:\n\n![Full-width image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x100){:.lead width=\"800\" height=\"100\" loading=\"lazy\"}\n\nA caption for an image.\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nAdding large quotes\n\nYou can make a quote “pop out” by adding the lead class.\n\nExample:\n\n\n  You can make a quote “pop out”.\n\n\nMarkdown:\n\n&gt; You can make a quote \"pop out\".\n{:.lead}\n\n\nAdding faded text\n\nYou can gray out text by adding the faded class. Use this sparingly and for information that is not essential, as it is more difficult to read.\n\nExample:\n\nI’m faded, faded, faded.\n\nMarkdown:\n\nI'm faded, faded, faded.\n{:.faded}\n\n\nAdding tables\n\nAdding tables is straightforward and works just as described in the kramdown docs, e.g.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n  \n\n\nMarkdown:\n\n| Default aligned | Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |\n| --------------- | :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |\n| First body part | Second cell  |   Third cell   |   fourth cell |\n\n\nHowever, it gets tricker when adding large tables.\nIn this case, Hydejack will break the layout and grant the table the entire available screen width to the right:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n    \n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n    \n    \n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n    \n    \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nTables adopts to the font size! You can decrease the size of the table by adding the smaller CSS class. Put {:.smaller} below the Markdown table, or add class=\"smaller\" to a HTML table.\n\nScroll table\n\nIf the extra space still isn’t enough, the table will receive a scrollbar.\nIt is browser default behavior to break the lines inside table cells to fit the content on the screen.\nBy adding the scroll-table class on a table, the behavior is changed to never break lines inside cells, e.g:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n    \n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n      Second line\n      foo\n      strong\n      baz\n    \n    \n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n      Third line\n      quux\n      baz\n      bar\n    \n    \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n      Second body\n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n      2 line\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n      Footer row\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can add the scroll-table class to a markdown table by putting {:.scroll-table} in line directly below the table.\nTo add the class to a HTML table, add the it to the class attribute of the table tag, e.g. &lt;table class=\"scroll-table\"&gt;.\n\nSmall tables\n\nIf a table is small enough to fit the screen even on small screens, you can add the stretch-table class\nto force a table to use the entire available content width. Note that stretched tables can no longer be scrolled.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Default aligned\n      Left aligned\n      Center aligned\n      Right aligned\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      First body part\n      Second cell\n      Third cell\n      fourth cell\n    \n  \n\n\nAn optional caption for a table\n\nYou can add the stretch-table class to a markdown table by putting {:.stretch-table} in line directly below the table.\nTo add the class to a HTML table, add the it to the class attribute of the table tag, e.g. &lt;table class=\"stretch-table\"&gt;.\n\nJust like images, you can add captions to tables by adding the figcaption class to the paragraph after the table.\n\nAn optional caption for a table\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nAdding code blocks\n\nTo add a code block without syntax highlighting, simply indent 4 spaces (regular markdown).\nFor code blocks with code highlighting, use ~~~&lt;language&gt;. This syntax is also supported by GitHub.\nFor more information and a list of supported languages, see Rouge.\n\nYou can give each code block a filename, by making the first line in the block a comment of the form File: \"dir/filename.ext\". Use either single quotes ', double quotes \", or backticks ` to surround the filename.\n\nExample:\n\n// file: \"code-block.js\"\n// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console\n\n// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those\n// arguments\nvar adder = new Function(\"a\", \"b\", \"return a + b\");\n\n// Call the function\nadder(2, 6);\n// &gt; 8\n\n\nAn optional caption for a code block\n\nMarkdown:\n\n~~~js\n// file: \"code-block.js\"\n// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console\n\n// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those\n// arguments\nvar adder = new Function(\"a\", \"b\", \"return a + b\");\n\n// Call the function\nadder(2, 6);\n// &gt; 8\n~~~\n\nAn optional caption for a code block\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nDO NOT use Jekyll’s { % highlight % } ... { % endhighlight % } syntax, especially together with the linenos option.\nThe generated table to render the line numbers does not have a CSS class or any other way of differentiating it from regular tables,\nso that the styles above apply, resulting in a broken page.\nWhat’s more, the output from highlight tags isn’t even valid HTML, nesting pre tags inside pre tags,\nwhich will in break the site during minification.\nYou can read more about it here and\nhere.\n\nAdding math\n\nBefore adding math blocks, make sure you’ve set up math support.\n\nInline\n\nExample:\n\nLorem ipsum \\(f(x) = x^2\\).\n\nMarkdown:\n\nLorem ipsum $$ f(x) = x^2 $$.\n\n\nBlock\n\nExample:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\phi(x,y) &amp;= \\phi \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \\sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \\right) \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \\phi(e_i, e_j)            \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n                 \\phi(e_1, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_1, e_n) \\\\\n                 \\vdots          &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots         \\\\\n                 \\phi(e_n, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_n, e_n)\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n                 y_1    \\\\\n                 \\vdots \\\\\n                 y_n\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nAn optional caption for a math block\n\nMarkdown:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} %!!15\n  \\phi(x,y) &amp;= \\phi \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \\sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \\right) \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \\phi(e_i, e_j)            \\\\[2em]\n            &amp;= (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n                 \\phi(e_1, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_1, e_n) \\\\\n                 \\vdots          &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots         \\\\\n                 \\phi(e_n, e_1)  &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi(e_n, e_n)\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n               \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n                 y_1    \\\\\n                 \\vdots \\\\\n                 y_n\n               \\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAn optional caption for a math block\n{:.figcaption}\n\n\nKaTeX does not support the align and align* environments.\nInstead, aligned should be used, e.g. \\begin{aligned} ... \\end{aligned}.\n\nContinue with Scripts\n\n",

Just add this line to your composer.json file:\n\n\"jv-conseil/dkim-php-mail-signature\": \"^1.0\"\n\n\nor run\n\ncomposer require jv-conseil/dkim-php-mail-signature\n\n\nNote that the vendor folder and the vendor/autoload.php script are generated by Composer; they are not part of DkimPhpMailSignature.\n\nMake your own copy of config file\n\nBefore starting you should make a copy of folder config/ and store it outside your vendor/ Composer repository in a non-public area of your website e.g.:\n\n/www/inc/config/jv-conseil/dkim-php-mail-signature/\n\n\nFailing to do so will expose you to lose all your settings in case of a future Composer udpate.\n\nGenerate your Public &amp; Private Encryption keys\n\nIn Terminal enter this command line to start working under the path of your config/ folder:\n\ncd /www/inc/config/jv-conseil/dkim-php-mail-signature/\n\n\nIn Terminal enter this command line to generate a new private 2048 bit encryption key:\n\nopenssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048\n\n\nEnter your Pass Phrase and save it for editing your config.inc.php file in the next step.\n\nThen retrieve your public key:\n\nopenssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout\n\n\nYou can delete the two originals *.pem file keys stored in the config/ folder if they create a conflict in the creation process of your keys.\n\nEdit your DNS with a new DKIM record\n\nAccess your registrar interface (e.g.: OVH.com) and create a new DKIM record to declare your public key:\n\nselector._domainkey  IN TXT  ( \"v=DKIM1;k=rsa;p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA0ekggNf9vuzzL4SlVc8QZyyqbEwR5bVTPC9cEZ8hFqTKOc7go180n3RZilYJZvveaxBkLCVJSTQaMPtKuSptY5au6Pi3AkFlizzhUJ80+0zgZXSGx7gfbginbRwhD+XdGOe9NXpo0PfrD6dEJ49Ytx4/nHB0TKiL227C0kGWb7RfWTVWccgJq4+kQb4l+4\" \"oDU5rGomSYK+zmMV13QTSETcJnoXhmjoJ30omyJfEXAsK5Ny0LJo8rWCucLD31BxHrM9/+M/Ye+TWxcrD2mRh5Jxqcnyj00/7kCnWeGPTftVKkAJBP3JMRqCNShLUchLhaz0qeXUtxAe9dx7ltr8042QIDAQAB;\" )\n\n\nDKIM works better with SPF and DMARC records, you should consider editing them too:\n\n3600     IN TXT  \"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all\"\n_dmarc   IN TXT  \"v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:me@yourdomain.name\"\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n  Add DKIM domain key to domain DNS records\n  Manage suspicious emails with DMARC\n  Help prevent email spoofing with SPF records\n\n\nEdit your Config File\n\nUnder config/config.sample.inc.php you will find a config file example to help you set your own details.\n\nNow you can drop .sample in the filename and start editing it:\n\n\n  domain: your domain name e.g: google.com\n  selector: selector used in your DKIM DNS record, e.g.: selector._domainkey.MAIL_DKIM_DOMAIN\n  passphrase: your pass phrase used to generate your keys e.g.: myPassPhrase.\n  … other parameters can be omitted.\n\n\nSimple Use\n\nSample lines to import into your mail code to start signing with DKIM:\n\nrequire_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php' ; // Autoload files using Composer autoload\nuse JVconseil\\DkimPhpMailSignature\\DKIMsign ;\nuse JVconseil\\DkimPhpMailSignature\\DKIMconfig ;\n\n// init\n$config = new DKIMconfig('/www/inc/config/jv-conseil/dkim-php-mail-signature/config.inc.php') ;\n\n// set: this calls __set()\n$config-&gt;domain = \"mynewdomain.name\" ;\n\n// get: this calls __get()\n$config-&gt;domain ; // =&gt; \"mynewdomain.name\" ;\n\n\nIntroducing DKIMmail class\n\n\n  📬 Stand-alone class to send DKIM signed emails with a 2048 bit private key hashed with SHA-256 algorithm.\n\n\n// init\n$mail = new DKIMmail('/www/inc/config/jv-conseil/dkim-php-mail-signature/config.inc.php') ;\n\n// parameters\n$mail-&gt;from    = \"Sender\" &lt;sender@yourdomain.com&gt; ;\n$mail-&gt;to      = \"Recipient\" &lt;recipient@yourdomain.com&gt; ;\n$mail-&gt;subject = \"Your Mail Subject\" ;\n$mail-&gt;body    = \"Your Mail Message.\" ;\n$mail-&gt;attach(\"/path/to/your/attachment.jpg\", \"NameOfYourAttachment.jpg\") ;\n\n// send!\n$mail-&gt;send() ;\n\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation is available online, though it may not be quite up to date or match your version exactly.\n\nYou can generate API documentation by running phpdoc in the top-level folder of this project, and documentation will be generated in this folder:\n\nphp ~/vendor/bin/phpdoc -d ~/dkim-php-mail-signature/ -t ~/dkim-php-mail-signature/docs/\n\n\nYou will need to have phpDocumentor installed.\n\nSponsorship\n\nIf this project helps you reduce time to develop, you can give me a cup of coffee ☕️ :-)\n\n\n",

Essentially that means developers across the world will continually work on it and fix security issues as part of a collaborative effort, making the app arguably more secure. There are concerns over whether Signal can maintain this free model as its user base increases to the tens, or potentially in the future, hundreds of millions. Signal is adamant it can continue to offer its service for free. “As a non-profit, we simply need to break even,” says Aruna Harder, the app’s COO. »\n➡️ https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/24/is-it-time-to-leave-whatsapp-and-is-signal-the-answer\n\nEuropeans are protected by GDPR and not impacted by Facebook new privacy policy 🇪🇺\n\n« La raison d’un tel afflux vient d’ailleurs : c’est avant tout une fuite des utilisateurs et utilisatrices de WhatsApp. Le 8 février prochain, la célèbre application de messagerie, propriété de Facebook, modifiera ses conditions d’utilisation : il ne sera plus possible de l’utiliser si l’on refuse le partage de données personnelles avec Facebook. L’entreprise précise toutefois qu’en raison des règlementations européennes, ce changement ne devrait avoir que peu d’impact pour les utilisateurs et utilisatrices en Europe. »\n\n➡️ https://www.franceinter.fr/societe/pourquoi-de-plus-en-plus-de-gens-quittent-whatsapp-pour-l-appli-signal\n\nTechnical limitation: Signal cannot import WhatsApp discussion dump 🚫\n\n\n\n« Is there a simple way for a non-techie to migrate WhatsApp history info into an existing active Signal account? »\n\n« As far as I know there is currently no easy way to do it »\n\n➡️ https://community.signalusers.org/t/migrate-from-whatsapp/10566/20\n\n« This fork of the Signal App aims at providing a method to import one’s WhatsApp conversations. It’s currently still a pretty tedious process, but at least it’s possible. »\n\n➡️ https://github.com/jukefoxer/Signal-Android/tree/feature/wa-db-import#whatsapp-data-import\n\n« Hi @signalapp 👋\n\nIs there a way to migrate conversations (texts, video, photos etc…) from a #WhatsApp group to a newly created #SignalApp group?\n\nI did not find such an answer while browsing your support pages 🤔 »\n\n➡️ https://twitter.com/JVconseil/status/1350473716807983109\n",

You must have permission to manage applications in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) on your Azure account.\n\nAdd a client secret in Certificates &amp; secrets &gt; Client secrets &gt; New client secret and note it down.\n\n\n\nCopy your client_id, tenant_id and client_secret and store them in environment variables (see .env folder for sample) or better still in an Azure Key Vault.\n\n\n\nAdd redirect URI like so:\n\n\n  https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/azure-signin/callback\n  https://127.0.0.1:8000/azure-signin/callback\n  https://localhost:8000/azure-signin/callback\n\n\nSettings\n\nAdd the following to your settings.py, replacing the variables in braces with the values\nfrom your Azure app:\n\nINSTALLED_APPS += [\n    \"azure_signin\",\n]\n\nAZURE_SIGNIN = {\n    \"CLIENT_ID\": os.environ.get(\"CLIENT_ID\"),  # Mandatory\n    \"CLIENT_SECRET\": os.environ.get(\"CLIENT_SECRET\"),  # Mandatory\n    \"TENANT_ID\": os.environ.get(\"TENANT_ID\"),  # Mandatory\n    \"SAVE_ID_TOKEN_CLAIMS\": True,  # Optional, default is False.\n    \"RENAME_ATTRIBUTES\": [\n        (\"employeeNumber\", \"employee_id\"),\n        (\"affiliationNumber\", \"omk2\"),\n    ],  # Optional\n    \"REDIRECT_URI\": \"https://&lt;domain&gt;/azure-signin/callback\",  # Optional\n    \"SCOPES\": [\"User.Read.All\"],  # Optional\n    \"AUTHORITY\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/\" + os.environ.get(\"TENANT_ID\"),  # Optional Or https://login.microsoftonline.com/common if multi-tenant\n    \"LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI\": \"https://&lt;domain&gt;/logout\",  # Optional\n    \"PUBLIC_URLS\": [\"&lt;public:view_name&gt;\",]  # Optional, public views accessible by non-authenticated users\n}\n\nAUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS += [\n    \"azure_signin.backends.AzureSigninBackend\",\n]\n\nLOGIN_URL = \"azure_signin:login\"\nLOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = \"/\" # Or any other endpoint\nLOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL\n\n\nInstalled apps\n\nAdd the following to your INSTALLED_APPS:\n\nINSTALLED_APPS += [\n    \"azure_signin\",\n]\n\n\nAuthentication backend\n\nConfigure the authentication backend:\n\nAUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS += [\n    \"azure_signin.backends.AzureSigninBackend\",\n]\n\n\nURLs\n\nInclude the app’s URLs in your urlpatterns:\n\nfrom django.urls import path, include\n\nurlpatterns += [\n    path(\"azure-signin/\", include(\"azure_signin.urls\", namespace=\"azure_signin\")),\n]\n\n\nUsage\n\nAbstractUser\n\nAdd extra attributes to users with AZURE_SIGNIN[\"RENAME_ATTRIBUTES\"]\nand Django django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser.\n\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser\nfrom django.db import models\n\n\nclass ExtendedUser(AbstractUser):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extend user with extra attributes set in `AZURE_SIGNIN[\"RENAME_ATTRIBUTES\"]`\n    \"\"\"\n\n    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, db_index=True)\n    employee_id = models.IntegerField(\n        null=True, default=None, unique=True, blank=True, db_index=True\n    )\n    omk2 = models.CharField(max_length=5, null=True, default=None, db_index=True)\n    hcm = models.CharField(max_length=7, null=True, default=None, db_index=True)\n\n\nBackend\n\nBackend can be subclassed to customize validation rules for user.\n\nimport logging\n\nfrom azure_signin.backends import AzureSigninBackend\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nclass CustomAzureSigninBackend(AzureSigninBackend):\n    \"Subclass AzureSigninBackend to customize validation rules for user.\"\n\n    def is_valid_user(self, user: dict, *args, **kwargs) -&gt; bool:\n        \"is_valid_user\"\n        output = super().is_valid_user(user, *args, **kwargs)\n        try:\n            \"run extra checks here...\"\n            pass\n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.exception(e)\n        logger.debug(\"is_valid_user: %s\", output)\n        return output\n\n\nDecorator\n\nTo make user authentication a requirement for accessing an individual view, decorate the\nview like so:\n\nfrom azure_signin.decorators import azure_signin_required\nfrom django.shortcuts import HttpResponse\n\n@azure_signin_required\ndef protected_view(request):\n    return HttpResponse(\"A view protected by the decorator\")\n\n\nMiddleware\n\nIf you want to protect your entire site by default, you can use the middleware by adding the\nfollowing to your settings.py:\n\nMIDDLEWARE += [\n    \"azure_signin.middleware.AzureSigninMiddleware\",\n]\n\n\nMake sure you add the middleware after Django’s session and authentication middlewares so\nthat the request includes the session and user objects. Public URLs which need to be accessed by\nnon-authenticated users should be specified in the settings.AZURE_SIGNIN[\"PUBLIC_URLS\"], as\nshown above.\n\nVS Code Tasks\n\nThe GitHub repository provides commands Install, Launch and Tests accessible through\nCommand Palette (press Cmd+Shift+P) then &gt;Tasks: Run Tasks.\n\n\n\n\nAll bash scripts are stored in .bash folder.\n\nThe virtual environment is propelled by poetry which can be installed with Homebrew brew install poetry.\n\nCredits\n\nThis app is inspired by and builds on functionality in\nhttps://github.com/AgileTek/django-azure-auth, with both feature\nimprovements, code coverage and extended documentation.\n\nReadings 📚\n\n\n  Quickstart: Add sign-in with Microsoft to a web app (docs.microsoft.com)\n  Microsoft Graph REST API v1.0 (docs.microsoft.com)\n  Enable your Python Django web app to sign in users to your Azure Active Directory tenant with the Microsoft identity platform (github.com)\n\n\nSponsorship\n\nIf this project helps you, you can offer me a cup of coffee ☕️ :-)\n\n\n",
